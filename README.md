# EXCEL_PROJECT_2
This project covers the essential of data cleaning. 

# INTRODUCTION

Data cleaning is a crucial step that contributes to the reliability, accuracy, and effectiveness of your data visualization and analysis. It ensures that your insights are based on sound data, leading to better decision-making and more impactful communication of results.
It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in your dataset to ensure that the data accurately reflects the real-world phenomena you are studying. 

# CREATING AN EXTRA WORKSHEET

Creating an extra worksheet enable working on the dataset without losing the original data, by making a copy of the original dataset, ensure that  there's a backup of the raw, unaltered data.
Data cleaning involves various transformations, corrections, and modifications to the dataset. Mistakes can happen, such as accidentally deleting or altering data that should have been kept. Having an original copy allows rectification of  errors without losing important information.
With the original dataset intact,  the flexibility to perform different types of data transformations and cleaning processes. Can experiment without the risk of permanently altering the raw data.

# DATA CLEANING

Data cleaning in Excel involves several steps to ensure the accuracy and quality of the data. 
This process includes utilizing the "Find and Replace" tool to correct consistent errors, employing proper functions to standardize formats, modifying headers for clarity, and removing null or missing values for more reliable analysis.

# DATA MANIPULATION

In data manipulation, the "Unique" function is applied to isolate distinct values in the CGPA column, Course column, and Martial Status. 
Additionally, the "Data Validation" function is utilized to ensure data accuracy.Lastly the "IFS" function is employed to create specific age brackets based on given conditions.

# CONCLUSION

 Here are some reasons why data cleaning is important before visualization:

* Accurate Insights: The quality of  visualizations and the insights drawn from them depend on the accuracy of  data. If  data is unclean and contains errors, visualizations could lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions.

* Eliminating Noise: Raw data often contains noise, which can be caused by various factors like measurement errors, duplicate entries, or even outliers. Cleaning the data helps remove this noise and allow focus on meaningful patterns.

* Consistency: Inconsistent or incompatible formats, units, and naming conventions can hinder analysis and visualization. Cleaning ensures that all data adheres to a consistent structure, making it easier to work with and interpret.

* Handling Missing Values: Datasets can have missing values, which can adversely affect analysis and visualization. Cleaning involves deciding how to handle missing data, whether through imputation or other methods, to prevent gaps in  insights.

* Enhancing Interpretability: Clean data makes it easier to understand and interpret the visualizations. When data is messy, it can be difficult to discern trends, relationships, and patterns.
